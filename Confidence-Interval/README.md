## Confidence Interval

### Overview

Ripple Renewable Energy (RRE) operates in the following U.S. states: 
California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas. The goal of this repo is to identify which of these states are most likely to be affected, should the new federal policy be enacted.

### Objectives

1. Provide a summary of the mean AQI for the states in which RRE operates.
2. Construct a boxplot visualization for AQI of these states using seaborn.
3. Evaluate which state(s) may be most affected by this policy, based on the data and your boxplot visualization.
4. Construct a confidence interval for the RRE state with the highest mean AQI.

#### 4-step process in constructing a confidence interval:

1. Identify a sample statistic.
2. Choose a confidence level.
3. Find the margin of error.
4. Calculate the interval.

#### margin of error = z * standard error
Confidence Level ->	Z Score
1.  90%         ->      	1.65
2.  95%         ->       	1.96
3.  99%         ->      	2.58
