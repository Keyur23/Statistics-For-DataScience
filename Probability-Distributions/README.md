## Overview

This notebook is part of a statistical analysis activity conducted for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The objective is to explore the distribution of air quality data, particularly focusing on carbon monoxide levels, and apply key statistical techniques such as:

#### 1. Identifying the shape and type of probability distribution

#### 2. Calculating Z-scores

#### 3. Detecting outliers

#### 4. Applying the empirical rule for normal distributions

These methods help in understanding where air quality improvements are most needed based on the regional data.

## Dataset

The dataset (modified_c4_epa_air_quality.csv) includes over 200 environmental monitoring sites across the U.S., with information on:

State, county, and city

Local site names

AQI (Air Quality Index) measurements for carbon monoxide
